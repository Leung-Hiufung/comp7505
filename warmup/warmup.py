WARMUP PROBLEMS

 Each problem will be assessed on three sets of tests:

1. "It works":
       Basic inputs and outputs, including the ones peovided as examples, with generous time and memory restrictions.
       Large inputs will not be tested here.
       The most straightforward approach will likely fit into these restrictions.

2. "Exhaustive":
       Extensive testing on a wide range of inputs and outputs with tight time and memory restrictions.
       These tests won't accept brute force solutions, you'll have to apply some algorithms and optimisations.

 3. "Welcome to COMP3506":
       Extensive testing with the tightest possible time and memory restrictions
       leaving no room for redundant operations.
       Every possible corner case will be assessed here as well.

There will be hidden tests in each category that will be published only after the assignment deadline.

    and minimise opponent's chance of winning.

    For the second example, if Alice picks 2 to increase her score, Bob will pick 3 and win. Alice does not want that.
    The same happens if she picks 1 or 0, but this time she won't even increase her score.
    The only scenario when Bob does not win immediately is if Alice picks 3.
    Then, Bob faces the same choice:
    pick 1 to increase his score knowing that Alice will pick 2 and win, or pick 2 himself.
    The same happens on the next move.
    So, nobody picks any numbers to increase their score, which results in a Tie with both players having scores of 0.
